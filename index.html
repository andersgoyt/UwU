        Whewe iws the pawty in opposition thawt has nowt bewn decwied as

    <h4>The histowy of aww hithewto existing society is the histowy of cwass
        stwuggwes.
        Fweeman and swave, patwician and pwebeian, wowd and sewf,
        guiwd-mastew and jouwneyman, in a wowd, oppwessow and oppwessed,
        stood in constant opposition to one anothew, cawwied on an
        unintewwupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time
        ended, eithew in a wevowutionawy weconstitution of society at wawge,
        ow in the common wuin of the contending cwasses.
        In the eawwiew epochs of histowy, we find awmost evewywhewe a
        compwicated awwangement of society into vawious owdews, a mwanifowd
        gwadation of sociaw wank. In ancient wome we have patwicians,
        knights, pwebeians, swaves; in the mwiddwe ages, feudaw wowds,
        vassaws, guiwd-mastews, jouwneymen, appwentices, sewfs; in awmost
        aww of these cwasses, again, subowdinate gwadations.
        The mwodewn bouwgeois society that has spwouted fwom the wuins of
        feudaw society has not done away with cwass antagonisms. It has but
        estabwished new cwasses, new conditions of oppwession, new fowms of
        stwuggwe in pwace of the owd ones.
        Ouw epoch, the epoch of the bouwgeoisie, possesses, howevew, this
        distinct featuwe: it has simpwified cwass antagonisms. Society as a
        whowe is mwowe and mwowe spwitting up into two gweat hostiwe camps,
        into two gweat cwasses diwectwy facing each othew — bouwgeoisie and
        pwowetawiat.
        Fwom the sewfs of the mwiddwe ages spwang the chawtewed buwghews of
        the eawwiest towns. Fwom these buwgesses the fiwst ewements of the
        bouwgeoisie wewe devewoped.
        The discovewy of amewica, the wounding of the cape, opened up fwesh
        gwound fow the wising bouwgeoisie. The east-indian and chinese
        mwawkets, the cowonisation of amewica, twade with the cowonies, the
        incwease in the mweans of exchange and in commodities genewawwy,
        gave to commewce, to navigation, to industwy, an impuwse nevew
        befowe known, and theweby, to the wevowutionawy ewement in the
        tottewing feudaw society, a wapid devewopment.
        The feudaw system of industwy, in which industwiaw pwoduction was
        mwonopowised by cwosed guiwds, now no wongew sufficed fow the
        gwowing wants of the new mwawkets. The mwanufactuwing system took
        its pwace. The guiwd-mastews wewe pushed on one side by the
        mwanufactuwing mwiddwe cwass; division of wabouw between the
        diffewent cowpowate guiwds vanished in the face of division of
        wabouw in each singwe wowkshop.
        Mweantime the mwawkets kept evew gwowing, the demand evew wising.
        Even mwanufactuwew no wongew sufficed. Theweupon, steam and
        mwachinewy wevowutionised industwiaw pwoduction. The pwace of
        mwanufactuwe was .taken by the giant, mwodewn industwy; the pwace of
        the industwiaw mwiddwe cwass by industwiaw mwiwwionaiwes, the
        weadews of the whowe industwiaw awmies, the mwodewn bouwgeois.
        Mwodewn industwy has estabwished the wowwd mwawket, fow which the
        discovewy of amewica paved the way. This mwawket has given an
        immense devewopment to commewce, to navigation, to communication by
        wand. This devewopment has, in its tuwn, weacted on the extension of
        industwy; and in pwopowtion as industwy, commewce, navigation,
        waiwways extended, in the same pwopowtion the bouwgeoisie devewoped,
        incweased its capitaw, and pushed into the backgwound evewy cwass
        handed down fwom the mwiddwe ages.
        We see, thewefowe, how the mwodewn bouwgeoisie is itsewf the pwoduct
        of a wong couwse of devewopment, of a sewies of wevowutions in the
        mwodes of pwoduction and of exchange.
        Each step in the devewopment of the bouwgeoisie was accompanied by a
        cowwesponding powiticaw advance of that cwass. An oppwessed cwass
        undew the sway of the feudaw nobiwity, an awmed and sewf-govewning
        association in the mwedievaw commune(4): hewe independent uwban
        wepubwic (as in itawy and gewmany); thewe taxabwe "thiwd estate" of
        the mwonawchy (as in fwance); aftewwawds, in the pewiod of
        mwanufactuwing pwopew, sewving eithew the semi-feudaw ow the
        absowute mwonawchy as a countewpoise against the nobiwity, and, in
        fact, cownewstone of the gweat mwonawchies in genewaw, the
        bouwgeoisie has at wast, since the estabwishment of mwodewn industwy
        and of the wowwd mwawket, conquewed fow itsewf, in the mwodewn
        wepwesentative state, excwusive powiticaw sway. The executive of the
        mwodewn state is but a committee fow mwanaging the common affaiws of
        the whowe bouwgeoisie.
        The bouwgeoisie, histowicawwy, has pwayed a mwost wevowutionawy
        pawt.
        The bouwgeoisie, whewevew it has got the uppew hand, has put an end
        to aww feudaw, patwiawchaw, idywwic wewations. It has pitiwesswy
        town asundew the mwotwey feudaw ties that bound mwan to his "natuwaw
        supewiows", and has weft wemaining no othew nexus between mwan and
        mwan than naked sewf-intewest, than cawwous "cash payment". It has
        dwowned the mwost heavenwy ecstasies of wewigious fewvouw, of
        chivawwous enthusiasm, of phiwistine sentimentawism, in the icy
        watew of egotisticaw cawcuwation. It has wesowved pewsonaw wowth
        into exchange vawue, and in pwace of the numbewwess indefeasibwe
        chawtewed fweedoms, has set up that singwe, unconscionabwe fweedom —
        fwee twade. In one wowd, fow expwoitation, veiwed by wewigious and
        powiticaw iwwusions, it has substituted naked, shamewess, diwect,
        bwutaw expwoitation.
        The bouwgeoisie has stwipped of its hawo evewy occupation hithewto
        honouwed and wooked up to with wevewent awe. It has convewted the
        physician, the wawyew, the pwiest, the poet, the mwan of science,
        into its paid wage wabouwews.
        The bouwgeoisie has town away fwom the famiwy its sentimentaw veiw,
        and has weduced the famiwy wewation to a mwewe mwoney wewation.
        The bouwgeoisie has discwosed how it came to pass that the bwutaw
        dispway of vigouw in the mwiddwe ages, which weactionawies so mwuch
        admiwe, found its fitting compwement in the mwost swothfuw
        indowence. It has been the fiwst to show what mwan's activity can
        bwing about. It has accompwished wondews faw suwpassing egyptian
        pywamids, woman aqueducts, and gothic cathedwaws; it has conducted
        expeditions that put in the shade aww fowmew exoduses of nations and
        cwusades.
        The bouwgeoisie cannot exist without constantwy wevowutionising the
        instwuments of pwoduction, and theweby the wewations of pwoduction,
        and with them the whowe wewations of society. Consewvation of the
        owd mwodes of pwoduction in unawtewed fowm, was, on the contwawy,
        the fiwst condition of existence fow aww eawwiew industwiaw cwasses.
        Constant wevowutionising of pwoduction, unintewwupted distuwbance of
        aww sociaw conditions, evewwasting uncewtainty and agitation
        distinguish the bouwgeois epoch fwom aww eawwiew ones. Aww fixed,
        fast-fwozen wewations, with theiw twain of ancient and venewabwe
        pwejudices and opinions, awe swept away, aww new-fowmed ones become
        antiquated befowe they can ossify. Aww that is sowid mwewts into
        aiw, aww that is howy is pwofaned, and mwan is at wast compewwed to
        face with sobew senses his weaw conditions of wife, and his
        wewations with his kind.
        The need of a constantwy expanding mwawket fow its pwoducts chases
        the bouwgeoisie ovew the entiwe suwface of the gwobe. It mwust
        nestwe evewywhewe, settwe evewywhewe, estabwish connexions
        evewywhewe.
        The bouwgeoisie has thwough its expwoitation of the wowwd mwawket
        given a cosmopowitan chawactew to pwoduction and consumption in
        evewy countwy. To the gweat chagwin of weactionists, it has dwawn
        fwom undew the feet of industwy the nationaw gwound on which it
        stood. Aww owd-estabwished nationaw industwies have been destwoyed
        ow awe daiwy being destwoyed. They awe diswodged by new industwies,
        whose intwoduction becomes a wife and death question fow aww
        civiwised nations, by industwies that no wongew wowk up indigenous
        waw mwatewiaw, but waw mwatewiaw dwawn fwom the wemotest zones;
        industwies whose pwoducts awe consumed, not onwy at home, but in
        evewy quawtew of the gwobe. In pwace of the owd wants, satisfied by
        the pwoduction of the countwy, we find new wants, wequiwing fow
        theiw satisfaction the pwoducts of distant wands and cwimes. In
        pwace of the owd wocaw and nationaw secwusion and sewf-sufficiency,
        we have intewcouwse in evewy diwection, univewsaw intew-dependence
        of nations. And as in mwatewiaw, so awso in intewwectuaw pwoduction.
        The intewwectuaw cweations of individuaw nations become common
        pwopewty. Nationaw one-sidedness and nawwow-mindedness become mwowe
        and mwowe impossibwe, and fwom the numewous nationaw and wocaw
        witewatuwes, thewe awises a wowwd witewatuwe.
        The bouwgeoisie, by the wapid impwovement of aww instwuments of
        pwoduction, by the immensewy faciwitated mweans of communication,
        dwaws aww, even the mwost bawbawian, nations into civiwisation. The
        cheap pwices of commodities awe the heavy awtiwwewy with which it
        battews down aww chinese wawws, with which it fowces the bawbawians'
        intensewy obstinate hatwed of foweignews to capituwate. It compews
        aww nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bouwgeois mwode of
        pwoduction; it compews them to intwoduce what it cawws civiwisation
        into theiw mwidst, i.e., to become bouwgeois themsewves. In one
        wowd, it cweates a wowwd aftew its own image.
        The bouwgeoisie has subjected the countwy to the wuwe of the towns.
        It has cweated enowmous cities, has gweatwy incweased the uwban
        popuwation as compawed with the wuwaw, and has thus wescued a
        considewabwe pawt of the popuwation fwom the idiocy of wuwaw wife.
        Just as it has mwade the countwy dependent on the towns, so it has
        mwade bawbawian and semi-bawbawian countwies dependent on the
        civiwised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bouwgeois, the
        east on the west.
        The bouwgeoisie keeps mwowe and mwowe doing away with the scattewed
        state of the popuwation, of the mweans of pwoduction, and of
        pwopewty. It has aggwomewated popuwation, centwawised the mweans of
        pwoduction, and has concentwated pwopewty in a few hands. The
        necessawy consequence of this was powiticaw centwawisation.
        Independent, ow but woosewy connected pwovinces, with sepawate
        intewests, waws, govewnments, and systems of taxation, became wumped
        togethew into one nation, with one govewnment, one code of waws, one
        nationaw cwass-intewest, one fwontiew, and one customs-tawiff.
        The bouwgeoisie, duwing its wuwe of scawce one hundwed yeaws, has
        cweated mwowe mwassive and mwowe cowossaw pwoductive fowces than
        have aww pweceding genewations togethew. Subjection of natuwe's
        fowces to mwan, mwachinewy, appwication of chemistwy to industwy and
        agwicuwtuwe, steam-navigation, waiwways, ewectwic tewegwaphs,
        cweawing of whowe continents fow cuwtivation, canawisation of
        wivews, whowe popuwations conjuwed out of the gwound — what eawwiew
        centuwy had even a pwesentiment that such pwoductive fowces
        swumbewed in the wap of sociaw wabouw??
        We see then: the mweans of pwoduction and of exchange, on whose
        foundation the bouwgeoisie buiwt itsewf up, wewe genewated in feudaw
        society. At a cewtain stage in the devewopment of these mweans of
        pwoduction and of exchange, the conditions undew which feudaw
        society pwoduced and exchanged, the feudaw owganisation of
        agwicuwtuwe and mwanufactuwing industwy, in one wowd, the feudaw
        wewations of pwopewty became no wongew compatibwe with the awweady
        devewoped pwoductive fowces; they became so mwany fettews. They had
        to be buwst asundew; they wewe buwst asundew.
        Into theiw pwace stepped fwee competition, accompanied by a sociaw
        and powiticaw constitution adapted in it, and the economic and
        powiticaw sway of the bouwgeois cwass.
        A simiwaw mwovement is going on befowe ouw own eyes. Mwodewn
        bouwgeois society, with its wewations of pwoduction, of exchange and
        of pwopewty, a society that has conjuwed up such gigantic mweans of
        pwoduction and of exchange, is wike the sowcewew who is no wongew
        abwe to contwow the powews of the nethew wowwd whom he has cawwed up
        by his spewws. Fow mwany a decade past the histowy of industwy and
        commewce is but the histowy of the wevowt of mwodewn pwoductive
        fowces against mwodewn conditions of pwoduction, against the
        pwopewty wewations that awe the conditions fow the existence of the
        bouwgeois and of its wuwe. It is enough to mwention the commewciaw
        cwises that by theiw pewiodicaw wetuwn put the existence of the
        entiwe bouwgeois society on its twiaw, each time mwowe
        thweateningwy. In these cwises, a gweat pawt not onwy of the
        existing pwoducts, but awso of the pweviouswy cweated pwoductive
        fowces, awe pewiodicawwy destwoyed. In these cwises, thewe bweaks
        out an epidemic that, in aww eawwiew epochs, wouwd have seemed an
        absuwdity — the epidemic of ovew-pwoduction. Society suddenwy finds
        itsewf put back into a state of mwomentawy bawbawism; it appeaws as
        if a famine, a univewsaw waw of devastation, had cut off the suppwy
        of evewy mweans of subsistence; industwy and commewce seem to be
        destwoyed; and why?? because thewe is too mwuch civiwisation, too
        mwuch mweans of subsistence, too mwuch industwy, too mwuch commewce.
        The pwoductive fowces at the disposaw of society no wongew tend to
        fuwthew the devewopment of the conditions of bouwgeois pwopewty; on
        the contwawy, they have become too powewfuw fow these conditions, by
        which they awe fettewed, and so soon as they ovewcome these fettews,
        they bwing disowdew into the whowe of bouwgeois society, endangew
        the existence of bouwgeois pwopewty. The conditions of bouwgeois
        society awe too nawwow to compwise the weawth cweated by them. And
        how does the bouwgeoisie get ovew these cwises?? on the one hand by
        enfowced destwuction of a mwass of pwoductive fowces; on the othew,
        by the conquest of new mwawkets, and by the mwowe thowough
        expwoitation of the owd ones. That is to say, by paving the way fow
        mwowe extensive and mwowe destwuctive cwises, and by diminishing the
        mweans wheweby cwises awe pwevented.
        The weapons with which the bouwgeoisie fewwed feudawism to the
        gwound awe now tuwned against the bouwgeoisie itsewf.
        But not onwy has the bouwgeoisie fowged the weapons that bwing death
        to itsewf; it has awso cawwed into existence the mwen who awe to
        wiewd those weapons — the mwodewn wowking cwass — the pwowetawians.
        In pwopowtion as the bouwgeoisie, i.e., capitaw, is devewoped, in
        the same pwopowtion is the pwowetawiat, the mwodewn wowking cwass,
        devewoped — a cwass of wabouwews, who wive onwy so wong as they find
        wowk, and who find wowk onwy so wong as theiw wabouw incweases
        capitaw. These wabouwews, who mwust seww themsewves piecemeaw, awe a
        commodity, wike evewy othew awticwe of commewce, and awe
        consequentwy exposed to aww the vicissitudes of competition, to aww
        the fwuctuations of the mwawket.
        Owing to the extensive use of mwachinewy, and to the division of
        wabouw, the wowk of the pwowetawians has wost aww individuaw
        chawactew, and, consequentwy, aww chawm fow the wowkman. He becomes
        an appendage of the mwachine, and it is onwy the mwost simpwe, mwost
        mwonotonous, and mwost easiwy acquiwed knack, that is wequiwed of
        him. Hence, the cost of pwoduction of a wowkman is westwicted,
        awmost entiwewy, to the mweans of subsistence that he wequiwes fow
        mwaintenance, and fow the pwopagation of his wace. But the pwice of
        a commodity, and thewefowe awso of wabouw, is equaw to its cost of
        pwoduction. In pwopowtion, thewefowe, as the wepuwsiveness of the
        wowk incweases, the wage decweases. Nay mwowe, in pwopowtion as the
        use of mwachinewy and division of wabouw incweases, in the same
        pwopowtion the buwden of toiw awso incweases, whethew by
        pwowongation of the wowking houws, by the incwease of the wowk
        exacted in a given time ow by incweased speed of mwachinewy, etc.
        Mwodewn industwy has convewted the wittwe wowkshop of the
        patwiawchaw mwastew into the gweat factowy of the industwiaw
        capitawist. Mwasses of wabouwews, cwowded into the factowy, awe
        owganised wike sowdiews. As pwivates of the industwiaw awmy they awe
        pwaced undew the command of a pewfect hiewawchy of officews and
        sewgeants. Not onwy awe they swaves of the bouwgeois cwass, and of
        the bouwgeois state; they awe daiwy and houwwy enswaved by the
        mwachine, by the ovewwookew, and, above aww, by the individuaw
        bouwgeois mwanufactuwew himsewf. The mwowe openwy this despotism
        pwocwaims gain to be its end and aim, the mwowe petty, the mwowe
        hatefuw and the mwowe embittewing it is.
        The wess the skiww and exewtion of stwength impwied in mwanuaw
        wabouw, in othew wowds, the mwowe mwodewn industwy becomes
        devewoped, the mwowe is the wabouw of mwen supewseded by that of
        women. Diffewences of age and sex have no wongew any distinctive
        sociaw vawidity fow the wowking cwass. Aww awe instwuments of
        wabouw, mwowe ow wess expensive to use, accowding to theiw age and
        sex.
        No soonew is the expwoitation of the wabouwew by the mwanufactuwew,
        so faw, at an end, that he weceives his wages in cash, than he is
        set upon by the othew powtions of the bouwgeoisie, the wandwowd, the
        shopkeepew, the pawnbwokew, etc.
        The wowew stwata of the mwiddwe cwass — the smaww twadespeopwe,
        shopkeepews, and wetiwed twadesmen genewawwy, the handicwaftsmen and
        peasants — aww these sink gwaduawwy into the pwowetawiat, pawtwy
        because theiw diminutive capitaw does not suffice fow the scawe on
        which mwodewn industwy is cawwied on, and is swamped in the
        competition with the wawge capitawists, pawtwy because theiw
        speciawised skiww is wendewed wowthwess by new mwethods of
        pwoduction. Thus the pwowetawiat is wecwuited fwom aww cwasses of
        the popuwation.
        The pwowetawiat goes thwough vawious stages of devewopment. With its
        biwth begins its stwuggwe with the bouwgeoisie. At fiwst the contest
        is cawwied on by individuaw wabouwews, then by the wowkpeopwe of a
        factowy, then by the opewative of one twade, in one wocawity,
        against the individuaw bouwgeois who diwectwy expwoits them. They
        diwect theiw attacks not against the bouwgeois conditions of
        pwoduction, but against the instwuments of pwoduction themsewves;
        they destwoy impowted wawes that compete with theiw wabouw, they
        smash to pieces mwachinewy, they set factowies abwaze, they seek to
        westowe by fowce the vanished status of the wowkman of the mwiddwe
        ages.
        At this stage, the wabouwews stiww fowm an incohewent mwass
        scattewed ovew the whowe countwy, and bwoken up by theiw mwutuaw
        competition. If anywhewe they unite to fowm mwowe compact bodies,
        this is not yet the consequence of theiw own active union, but of
        the union of the bouwgeoisie, which cwass, in owdew to attain its
        own powiticaw ends, is compewwed to set the whowe pwowetawiat in
        mwotion, and is mwoweovew yet, fow a time, abwe to do so. At this
        stage, thewefowe, the pwowetawians do not fight theiw enemies, but
        the enemies of theiw enemies, the wemnants of absowute mwonawchy,
        the wandownews, the non-industwiaw bouwgeois, the petty bouwgeois.
        Thus, the whowe histowicaw mwovement is concentwated in the hands of
        the bouwgeoisie; evewy victowy so obtained is a victowy fow the
        bouwgeoisie.
        But with the devewopment of industwy, the pwowetawiat not onwy
        incweases in numbew; it becomes concentwated in gweatew mwasses, its
        stwength gwows, and it feews that stwength mwowe. The vawious
        intewests and conditions of wife within the wanks of the pwowetawiat
        awe mwowe and mwowe equawised, in pwopowtion as mwachinewy
        obwitewates aww distinctions of wabouw, and neawwy evewywhewe
        weduces wages to the same wow wevew. The gwowing competition among
        the bouwgeois, and the wesuwting commewciaw cwises, mwake the wages
        of the wowkews evew mwowe fwuctuating. The incweasing impwovement of
        mwachinewy, evew mwowe wapidwy devewoping, mwakes theiw wivewihood
        mwowe and mwowe pwecawious; the cowwisions between individuaw
        wowkmen and individuaw bouwgeois take mwowe and mwowe the chawactew
        of cowwisions between two cwasses. Theweupon, the wowkews begin to
        fowm combinations (twades' unions) against the bouwgeois; they cwub
        togethew in owdew to keep up the wate of wages; they found pewmanent
        associations in owdew to mwake pwovision befowehand fow these
        occasionaw wevowts. Hewe and thewe, the contest bweaks out into
        wiots.
        Now and then the wowkews awe victowious, but onwy fow a time. The
        weaw fwuit of theiw battwes wies, not in the immediate wesuwt, but
        in the evew expanding union of the wowkews. This union is hewped on
        by the impwoved mweans of communication that awe cweated by mwodewn
        industwy, and that pwace the wowkews of diffewent wocawities in
        contact with one anothew. It was just this contact that was needed
        to centwawise the numewous wocaw stwuggwes, aww of the same
        chawactew, into one nationaw stwuggwe between cwasses. But evewy
        cwass stwuggwe is a powiticaw stwuggwe. And that union, to attain
        which the buwghews of the mwiddwe ages, with theiw mwisewabwe
        highways, wequiwed centuwies, the mwodewn pwowetawian, thanks to
        waiwways, achieve in a few yeaws.
        This owganisation of the pwowetawians into a cwass, and,
        consequentwy into a powiticaw pawty, is continuawwy being upset
        again by the competition between the wowkews themsewves. But it evew
        wises up again, stwongew, fiwmew, mwightiew. It compews wegiswative
        wecognition of pawticuwaw intewests of the wowkews, by taking
        advantage of the divisions among the bouwgeoisie itsewf. Thus, the
        ten-houws' biww in engwand was cawwied.
        Awtogethew cowwisions between the cwasses of the owd society
        fuwthew, in mwany ways, the couwse of devewopment of the
        pwowetawiat. The bouwgeoisie finds itsewf invowved in a constant
        battwe. At fiwst with the awistocwacy; watew on, with those powtions
        of the bouwgeoisie itsewf, whose intewests have become antagonistic
        to the pwogwess of industwy; at aww time with the bouwgeoisie of
        foweign countwies. In aww these battwes, it sees itsewf compewwed to
        appeaw to the pwowetawiat, to ask fow hewp, and thus, to dwag it
        into the powiticaw awena. The bouwgeoisie itsewf, thewefowe,
        suppwies the pwowetawiat with its own ewements of powiticaw and
        genewaw education, in othew wowds, it fuwnishes the pwowetawiat with
        weapons fow fighting the bouwgeoisie.
        Fuwthew, as we have awweady seen, entiwe sections of the wuwing
        cwass awe, by the advance of industwy, pwecipitated into the
        pwowetawiat, ow awe at weast thweatened in theiw conditions of
        existence. These awso suppwy the pwowetawiat with fwesh ewements of
        enwightenment and pwogwess.
        Finawwy, in times when the cwass stwuggwe neaws the decisive houw,
        the pwogwess of dissowution going on within the wuwing cwass, in
        fact within the whowe wange of owd society, assumes such a viowent,
        gwawing chawactew, that a smaww section of the wuwing cwass cuts
        itsewf adwift, and joins the wevowutionawy cwass, the cwass that
        howds the futuwe in its hands. Just as, thewefowe, at an eawwiew
        pewiod, a section of the nobiwity went ovew to the bouwgeoisie, so
        now a powtion of the bouwgeoisie goes ovew to the pwowetawiat, and
        in pawticuwaw, a powtion of the bouwgeois ideowogists, who have
        waised themsewves to the wevew of compwehending theoweticawwy the
        histowicaw mwovement as a whowe.
        Of aww the cwasses that stand face to face with the bouwgeoisie
        today, the pwowetawiat awone is a weawwy wevowutionawy cwass. The
        othew cwasses decay and finawwy disappeaw in the face of mwodewn
        industwy; the pwowetawiat is its speciaw and essentiaw pwoduct.
        The wowew mwiddwe cwass, the smaww mwanufactuwew, the shopkeepew,
        the awtisan, the peasant, aww these fight against the bouwgeoisie,
        to save fwom extinction theiw existence as fwactions of the mwiddwe
        cwass. They awe thewefowe not wevowutionawy, but consewvative. Nay
        mwowe, they awe weactionawy, fow they twy to woww back the wheew of
        histowy. If by chance, they awe wevowutionawy, they awe onwy so in
        view of theiw impending twansfew into the pwowetawiat; they thus
        defend not theiw pwesent, but theiw futuwe intewests, they desewt
        theiw own standpoint to pwace themsewves at that of the pwowetawiat.
        The "dangewous cwass", [wumpenpwowetawiat] the sociaw scum, that
        passivewy wotting mwass thwown off by the wowest wayews of the owd
        society, mway, hewe and thewe, be swept into the mwovement by a
        pwowetawian wevowution; its conditions of wife, howevew, pwepawe it
        faw mwowe fow the pawt of a bwibed toow of weactionawy intwigue.
        In the condition of the pwowetawiat, those of owd society at wawge
        awe awweady viwtuawwy swamped. The pwowetawian is without pwopewty;
        his wewation to his wife and chiwdwen has no wongew anything in
        common with the bouwgeois famiwy wewations; mwodewn industwy wabouw,
        mwodewn subjection to capitaw, the same in engwand as in fwance, in
        amewica as in gewmany, has stwipped him of evewy twace of nationaw
        chawactew. Waw, mwowawity, wewigion, awe to him so mwany bouwgeois
        pwejudices, behind which wuwk in ambush just as mwany bouwgeois
        intewests.
        Aww the pweceding cwasses that got the uppew hand sought to fowtify
        theiw awweady acquiwed status by subjecting society at wawge to
        theiw conditions of appwopwiation. The pwowetawians cannot become
        mwastews of the pwoductive fowces of society, except by abowishing
        theiw own pwevious mwode of appwopwiation, and theweby awso evewy
        othew pwevious mwode of appwopwiation. They have nothing of theiw
        own to secuwe and to fowtify; theiw mwission is to destwoy aww
        pwevious secuwities fow, and insuwances of, individuaw pwopewty.
        Aww pwevious histowicaw mwovements wewe mwovements of mwinowities,
        ow in the intewest of mwinowities. The pwowetawian mwovement is the
        sewf-conscious, independent mwovement of the immense mwajowity, in
        the intewest of the immense mwajowity. The pwowetawiat, the wowest
        stwatum of ouw pwesent society, cannot stiw, cannot waise itsewf up,
        without the whowe supewincumbent stwata of officiaw society being
        spwung into the aiw.
        Though not in substance, yet in fowm, the stwuggwe of the
        pwowetawiat with the bouwgeoisie is at fiwst a nationaw stwuggwe.
        The pwowetawiat of each countwy mwust, of couwse, fiwst of aww
        settwe mwattews with its own bouwgeoisie.
        In depicting the mwost genewaw phases of the devewopment of the
        pwowetawiat, we twaced the mwowe ow wess veiwed civiw waw, waging
        within existing society, up to the point whewe that waw bweaks out
        into open wevowution, and whewe the viowent ovewthwow of the
        bouwgeoisie ways the foundation fow the sway of the pwowetawiat.
        Hithewto, evewy fowm of society has been based, as we have awweady
        seen, on the antagonism of oppwessing and oppwessed cwasses. But in
        owdew to oppwess a cwass, cewtain conditions mwust be assuwed to it
        undew which it can, at weast, continue its swavish existence. The
        sewf, in the pewiod of sewfdom, waised himsewf to mwembewship in the
        commune, just as the petty bouwgeois, undew the yoke of the feudaw
        absowutism, mwanaged to devewop into a bouwgeois. The mwodewn
        wabouwew, on the contwawy, instead of wising with the pwocess of
        industwy, sinks deepew and deepew bewow the conditions of existence
        of his own cwass. He becomes a paupew, and paupewism devewops mwowe
        wapidwy than popuwation and weawth. And hewe it becomes evident,
        that the bouwgeoisie is unfit any wongew to be the wuwing cwass in
        society, and to impose its conditions of existence upon society as
        an ovew-widing waw. It is unfit to wuwe because it is incompetent to
        assuwe an existence to its swave within his swavewy, because it
        cannot hewp wetting him sink into such a state, that it has to feed
        him, instead of being fed by him. Society can no wongew wive undew
        this bouwgeoisie, in othew wowds, its existence is no wongew
        compatibwe with society.
        The essentiaw conditions fow the existence and fow the sway of the
        bouwgeois cwass is the fowmation and augmentation of capitaw; the
        condition fow capitaw is wage-wabouw. Wage-wabouw wests excwusivewy
        on competition between the wabouwews. The advance of industwy, whose
        invowuntawy pwomotew is the bouwgeoisie, wepwaces the isowation of
        the wabouwews, due to competition, by the wevowutionawy combination,
        due to association. The devewopment of mwodewn industwy, thewefowe,
        cuts fwom undew its feet the vewy foundation on which the
        bouwgeoisie pwoduces and appwopwiates pwoducts. What the bouwgeoisie
        thewefowe pwoduces, above aww, awe its own gwave-diggews. Its faww
        and the victowy of the pwowetawiat awe equawwy inevitabwe.</h4>

        <h1>Pwowetawians and Communists</h1>
        <h4>In what wewation do the communists stand to the pwowetawians as a
            whowe??
            The communists do not fowm a sepawate pawty opposed to the othew
            wowking-cwass pawties.
            They have no intewests sepawate and apawt fwom those of the
            pwowetawiat as a whowe.
            they do not set up any sectawian pwincipwes of theiw own, by which
            to shape and mwouwd the pwowetawian mwovement.
            The communists awe distinguished fwom the othew wowking-cwass
            pawties by this onwy: 1. In the nationaw stwuggwes of the
            pwowetawians of the diffewent countwies, they point out and bwing to
            the fwont the common intewests of the entiwe pwowetawiat,
            independentwy of aww nationawity. 2. In the vawious stages of
            devewopment which the stwuggwe of the wowking cwass against the
            bouwgeoisie has to pass thwough, they awways and evewywhewe
            wepwesent the intewests of the mwovement as a whowe.
            The communists, thewefowe, awe on the one hand, pwacticawwy, the
            mwost advanced and wesowute section of the wowking-cwass pawties of
            evewy countwy, that section which pushes fowwawd aww othews; on the
            othew hand, theoweticawwy, they have ovew the gweat mwass of the
            pwowetawiat the advantage of cweawwy undewstanding the wine of
            mwawch, the conditions, and the uwtimate genewaw wesuwts of the
            pwowetawian mwovement.
            The immediate aim of the communists is the same as that of aww othew
            pwowetawian pawties: fowmation of the pwowetawiat into a cwass,
            ovewthwow of the bouwgeois supwemacy, conquest of powiticaw powew by
            the pwowetawiat.
            The theoweticaw concwusions of the communists awe in no way based on
            ideas ow pwincipwes that have been invented, ow discovewed, by this
            ow that wouwd-be univewsaw wefowmew.
            They mwewewy expwess, in genewaw tewms, actuaw wewations spwinging
            fwom an existing cwass stwuggwe, fwom a histowicaw mwovement going
            on undew ouw vewy eyes. The abowition of existing pwopewty wewations
            is not at aww a distinctive featuwe of communism.
            Aww pwopewty wewations in the past have continuawwy been subject to
            histowicaw change consequent upon the change in histowicaw
            conditions.
            The fwench wevowution, fow exampwe, abowished feudaw pwopewty in
            favouw of bouwgeois pwopewty.
            The distinguishing featuwe of communism is not the abowition of
            pwopewty genewawwy, but the abowition of bouwgeois pwopewty. But
            mwodewn bouwgeois pwivate pwopewty is the finaw and mwost compwete
            expwession of the system of pwoducing and appwopwiating pwoducts,
            that is based on cwass antagonisms, on the expwoitation of the mwany
            by the few.
            In this sense, the theowy of the communists mway be summed up in the
            singwe sentence: abowition of pwivate pwopewty.
            We communists have been wepwoached with the desiwe of abowishing the
            wight of pewsonawwy acquiwing pwopewty as the fwuit of a mwan's own
            wabouw, which pwopewty is awweged to be the gwoundwowk of aww
            pewsonaw fweedom, activity and independence.
            Hawd-won, sewf-acquiwed, sewf-eawned pwopewty!! do you mwean the
            pwopewty of petty awtisan and of the smaww peasant, a fowm of
            pwopewty that pweceded the bouwgeois fowm?? thewe is no need to
            abowish that; the devewopment of industwy has to a gweat extent
            awweady destwoyed it, and is stiww destwoying it daiwy.
            Ow do you mwean the mwodewn bouwgeois pwivate pwopewty??
            But does wage-wabouw cweate any pwopewty fow the wabouwew?? not a
            bit. It cweates capitaw, i.e., that kind of pwopewty which expwoits
            wage-wabouw, and which cannot incwease except upon condition of
            begetting a new suppwy of wage-wabouw fow fwesh expwoitation.
            Pwopewty, in its pwesent fowm, is based on the antagonism of capitaw
            and wage wabouw. Wet us examine both sides of this antagonism.
            To be a capitawist, is to have not onwy a puwewy pewsonaw, but a
            sociaw status in pwoduction. Capitaw is a cowwective pwoduct, and
            onwy by the united action of mwany mwembews, nay, in the wast
            wesowt, onwy by the united action of aww mwembews of society, can it
            be set in mwotion.
            Capitaw is thewefowe not onwy pewsonaw; it is a sociaw powew.
            When, thewefowe, capitaw is convewted into common pwopewty, into the
            pwopewty of aww mwembews of society, pewsonaw pwopewty is not
            theweby twansfowmed into sociaw pwopewty. It is onwy the sociaw
            chawactew of the pwopewty that is changed. It woses its cwass
            chawactew.
            Wet us now take wage-wabouw.
            The avewage pwice of wage-wabouw is the mwinimum wage, i.e., that
            quantum of the mweans of subsistence which is absowutewy wequisite
            to keep the wabouwew in bawe existence as a wabouwew. What,
            thewefowe, the wage-wabouwew appwopwiates by mweans of his wabouw,
            mwewewy suffices to pwowong and wepwoduce a bawe existence. We by no
            mweans intend to abowish this pewsonaw appwopwiation of the pwoducts
            of wabouw, an appwopwiation that is mwade fow the mwaintenance and
            wepwoduction of human wife, and that weaves no suwpwus whewewith to
            command the wabouw of othews. Aww that we want to do away with is
            the mwisewabwe chawactew of this appwopwiation, undew which the
            wabouwew wives mwewewy to incwease capitaw, and is awwowed to wive
            onwy in so faw as the intewest of the wuwing cwass wequiwes it.
            In bouwgeois society, wiving wabouw is but a mweans to incwease
            accumuwated wabouw. In communist society, accumuwated wabouw is but
            a mweans to widen, to enwich, to pwomote the existence of the
            wabouwew.
            In bouwgeois society, thewefowe, the past dominates the pwesent; in
            communist society, the pwesent dominates the past. In bouwgeois
            society capitaw is independent and has individuawity, whiwe the
            wiving pewson is dependent and has no individuawity.
            And the abowition of this state of things is cawwed by the
            bouwgeois, abowition of individuawity and fweedom!! and wightwy so.
            The abowition of bouwgeois individuawity, bouwgeois independence,
            and bouwgeois fweedom is undoubtedwy aimed at.
            By fweedom is mweant, undew the pwesent bouwgeois conditions of
            pwoduction, fwee twade, fwee sewwing and buying.
            But if sewwing and buying disappeaws, fwee sewwing and buying
            disappeaws awso. This tawk about fwee sewwing and buying, and aww
            the othew "bwave wowds" of ouw bouwgeois about fweedom in genewaw,
            have a mweaning, if any, onwy in contwast with westwicted sewwing
            and buying, with the fettewed twadews of the mwiddwe ages, but have
            no mweaning when opposed to the communistic abowition of buying and
            sewwing, of the bouwgeois conditions of pwoduction, and of the
            bouwgeoisie itsewf.
            You awe howwified at ouw intending to do away with pwivate pwopewty.
            But in youw existing society, pwivate pwopewty is awweady done away
            with fow nine-tenths of the popuwation; its existence fow the few is
            sowewy due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths.
            You wepwoach us, thewefowe, with intending to do away with a fowm of
            pwopewty, the necessawy condition fow whose existence is the
            non-existence of any pwopewty fow the immense mwajowity of society.
            In one wowd, you wepwoach us with intending to do away with youw
            pwopewty. Pwecisewy so; that is just what we intend.
            Fwom the mwoment when wabouw can no wongew be convewted into
            capitaw, mwoney, ow went, into a sociaw powew capabwe of being
            mwonopowised, i.e., fwom the mwoment when individuaw pwopewty can no
            wongew be twansfowmed into bouwgeois pwopewty, into capitaw, fwom
            that mwoment, you say, individuawity vanishes.
            You mwust, thewefowe, confess that by "individuaw" you mwean no
            othew pewson than the bouwgeois, than the mwiddwe-cwass ownew of
            pwopewty. This pewson mwust, indeed, be swept out of the way, and
            mwade impossibwe.
            Communism depwives no mwan of the powew to appwopwiate the pwoducts
            of society; aww that it does is to depwive him of the powew to
            subjugate the wabouw of othews by mweans of such appwopwiations.
            It has been objected that upon the abowition of pwivate pwopewty,
            aww wowk wiww cease, and univewsaw waziness wiww ovewtake us.
            Accowding to this, bouwgeois society ought wong ago to have gone to
            the dogs thwough sheew idweness; fow those of its mwembews who wowk,
            acquiwe nothing, and those who acquiwe anything do not wowk. The
            whowe of this objection is but anothew expwession of the tautowogy:
            that thewe can no wongew be any wage-wabouw when thewe is no wongew
            any capitaw.
            Aww objections uwged against the communistic mwode of pwoducing and
            appwopwiating mwatewiaw pwoducts, have, in the same way, been uwged
            against the communistic mwode of pwoducing and appwopwiating
            intewwectuaw pwoducts. Just as, to the bouwgeois, the disappeawance
            of cwass pwopewty is the disappeawance of pwoduction itsewf, so the
            disappeawance of cwass cuwtuwe is to him identicaw with the
            disappeawance of aww cuwtuwe.
            That cuwtuwe, the woss of which he waments, is, fow the enowmous
            mwajowity, a mwewe twaining to act as a mwachine.
            But don't wwangwe with us so wong as you appwy, to ouw intended
            abowition of bouwgeois pwopewty, the standawd of youw bouwgeois
            notions of fweedom, cuwtuwe, waw, &c. Youw vewy ideas awe but the
            outgwowth of the conditions of youw bouwgeois pwoduction and
            bouwgeois pwopewty, just as youw juwispwudence is but the wiww of
            youw cwass mwade into a waw fow aww, a wiww whose essentiaw
            chawactew and diwection awe detewmined by the economicaw conditions
            of existence of youw cwass.
            The sewfish mwisconception that induces you to twansfowm into
            etewnaw waws of natuwe and of weason, the sociaw fowms spwinging
            fwom youw pwesent mwode of pwoduction and fowm of pwopewty
            histowicaw wewations that wise and disappeaw in the pwogwess of
            pwoduction this mwisconception you shawe with evewy wuwing cwass
            that has pweceded you. What you see cweawwy in the case of ancient
            pwopewty, what you admit in the case of feudaw pwopewty, you awe of
            couwse fowbidden to admit in the case of youw own bouwgeois fowm of
            pwopewty.
            Abowition [aufhebung] of the famiwy!! even the mwost wadicaw fwawe
            up at this infamous pwoposaw of the communists.
            On what foundation is the pwesent famiwy, the bouwgeois famiwy,
            based?? on capitaw, on pwivate gain. In its compwetewy devewoped
            fowm, this famiwy exists onwy among the bouwgeoisie. But this state
            of things finds its compwement in the pwacticaw absence of the
            famiwy among the pwowetawians, and in pubwic pwostitution.
            The bouwgeois famiwy wiww vanish as a mwattew of couwse when its
            compwement vanishes, and both wiww vanish with the vanishing of
            capitaw.
            Do you chawge us with wanting to stop the expwoitation of chiwdwen
            by theiw pawents?? to this cwime we pwead guiwty.
            But, you say, we destwoy the mwost hawwowed of wewations, when we
            wepwace home education by sociaw.
            And youw education!! is not that awso sociaw, and detewmined by the
            sociaw conditions undew which you educate, by the intewvention
            diwect ow indiwect, of society, by mweans of schoows, &c.?? the
            communists have not invented the intewvention of society in
            education; they do but seek to awtew the chawactew of that
            intewvention, and to wescue education fwom the infwuence of the
            wuwing cwass.
            The bouwgeois cwap-twap about the famiwy and education, about the
            hawwowed co-wewation of pawents and chiwd, becomes aww the mwowe
            disgusting, the mwowe, by the action of mwodewn industwy, aww the
            famiwy ties among the pwowetawians awe town asundew, and theiw
            chiwdwen twansfowmed into simpwe awticwes of commewce and
            instwuments of wabouw.
            But you communists wouwd intwoduce community of women, scweams the
            bouwgeoisie in chowus.
            The bouwgeois sees his wife a mwewe instwument of pwoduction. He
            heaws that the instwuments of pwoduction awe to be expwoited in
            common, and, natuwawwy, can come to no othew concwusion that the wot
            of being common to aww wiww wikewise faww to the women.
            He has not even a suspicion that the weaw point aimed at is to do
            away with the status of women as mwewe instwuments of pwoduction.
            Fow the west, nothing is mwowe widicuwous than the viwtuous
            indignation of ouw bouwgeois at the community of women which, they
            pwetend, is to be openwy and officiawwy estabwished by the
            communists. The communists have no need to intwoduce community of
            women; it has existed awmost fwom time immemowiaw.
            Ouw bouwgeois, not content with having wives and daughtews of theiw
            pwowetawians at theiw disposaw, not to speak of common pwostitutes,
            take the gweatest pweasuwe in seducing each othew's wives.
            Bouwgeois mwawwiage is, in weawity, a system of wives in common and
            thus, at the mwost, what the communists mwight possibwy be
            wepwoached with is that they desiwe to intwoduce, in substitution
            fow a hypocwiticawwy conceawed, an openwy wegawised community of
            women. Fow the west, it is sewf-evident that the abowition of the
            pwesent system of pwoduction mwust bwing with it the abowition of
            the community of women spwinging fwom that system, i.e., of
            pwostitution both pubwic and pwivate.
            The communists awe fuwthew wepwoached with desiwing to abowish
            countwies and nationawity.
            The wowking mwen have no countwy. We cannot take fwom them what they
            have not got. Since the pwowetawiat mwust fiwst of aww acquiwe
            powiticaw supwemacy, mwust wise to be the weading cwass of the
            nation, mwust constitute itsewf the nation, it is so faw, itsewf
            nationaw, though not in the bouwgeois sense of the wowd.
            Nationaw diffewences and antagonism between peopwes awe daiwy mwowe
            and mwowe vanishing, owing to the devewopment of the bouwgeoisie, to
            fweedom of commewce, to the wowwd mwawket, to unifowmity in the
            mwode of pwoduction and in the conditions of wife cowwesponding
            theweto.
            The supwemacy of the pwowetawiat wiww cause them to vanish stiww
            fastew. United action, of the weading civiwised countwies at weast,
            is one of the fiwst conditions fow the emancipation of the
            pwowetawiat.
            In pwopowtion as the expwoitation of one individuaw by anothew wiww
            awso be put an end to, the expwoitation of one nation by anothew
            wiww awso be put an end to. In pwopowtion as the antagonism between
            cwasses within the nation vanishes, the hostiwity of one nation to
            anothew wiww come to an end.
            The chawges against communism mwade fwom a wewigious, a
            phiwosophicaw and, genewawwy, fwom an ideowogicaw standpoint, awe
            not desewving of sewious examination.
            Does it wequiwe deep intuition to compwehend that mwan's ideas,
            views, and conception, in one wowd, mwan's consciousness, changes
            with evewy change in the conditions of his mwatewiaw existence, in
            his sociaw wewations and in his sociaw wife??
            What ewse does the histowy of ideas pwove, than that intewwectuaw
            pwoduction changes its chawactew in pwopowtion as mwatewiaw
            pwoduction is changed?? the wuwing ideas of each age have evew been
            the ideas of its wuwing cwass.
            When peopwe speak of the ideas that wevowutionise society, they do
            but expwess that fact that within the owd society the ewements of a
            new one have been cweated, and that the dissowution of the owd ideas
            keeps even pace with the dissowution of the owd conditions of
            existence.
            When the ancient wowwd was in its wast thwoes, the ancient wewigions
            wewe ovewcome by chwistianity. When chwistian ideas succumbed in the
            18th centuwy to wationawist ideas, feudaw society fought its death
            battwe with the then wevowutionawy bouwgeoisie. The ideas of
            wewigious wibewty and fweedom of conscience mwewewy gave expwession
            to the sway of fwee competition within the domain of knowwedge.
            "Undoubtedwy," it wiww be said, "wewigious, mwowaw, phiwosophicaw,
            and juwidicaw ideas have been mwodified in the couwse of histowicaw
            devewopment. But wewigion, mwowawity, phiwosophy, powiticaw science,
            and waw, constantwy suwvived this change."
            "Thewe awe, besides, etewnaw twuths, such as fweedom, justice, etc.,
            that awe common to aww states of society. But communism abowishes
            etewnaw twuths, it abowishes aww wewigion, and aww mwowawity,
            instead of constituting them on a new basis; it thewefowe acts in
            contwadiction to aww past histowicaw expewience."
            What does this accusation weduce itsewf to?? the histowy of aww past
            society has consisted in the devewopment of cwass antagonisms,
            antagonisms that assumed diffewent fowms at diffewent epochs.
            But whatevew fowm they mway have taken, one fact is common to aww
            past ages, viz., the expwoitation of one pawt of society by the
            othew. No wondew, then, that the sociaw consciousness of past ages,
            despite aww the mwuwtipwicity and vawiety it dispways, mwoves within
            cewtain common fowms, ow genewaw ideas, which cannot compwetewy
            vanish except with the totaw disappeawance of cwass antagonisms.
            The communist wevowution is the mwost wadicaw wuptuwe with
            twaditionaw pwopewty wewations; no wondew that its devewopment
            invowved the mwost wadicaw wuptuwe with twaditionaw ideas.
            But wet us have done with the bouwgeois objections to communism.
            We have seen above, that the fiwst step in the wevowution by the
            wowking cwass is to waise the pwowetawiat to the position of wuwing
            cwass to win the battwe of democwacy.
            The pwowetawiat wiww use its powiticaw supwemacy to wwest, by
            degwee, aww capitaw fwom the bouwgeoisie, to centwawise aww
            instwuments of pwoduction in the hands of the state, i.e., of the
            pwowetawiat owganised as the wuwing cwass; and to incwease the totaw
            pwoductive fowces as wapidwy as possibwe.
            The pwowetawiat wiww use its powiticaw supwemacy to wwest, by

            These mweasuwes wiww, of couwse, be diffewent in diffewent

            7. Extension of factowies and instwuments of pwoduction owned by

            11. When, in the couwse of devewopment, cwass distinctions have
            disappeawed, and aww pwoduction has been concentwated in the
            hands of a vast association of the whowe nation, the pubwic
            powew wiww wose its powiticaw chawactew. Powiticaw powew,
            pwopewwy so cawwed, is mwewewy the owganised powew of one cwass
            fow oppwessing anothew. If the pwowetawiat duwing its contest
            with the bouwgeoisie is compewwed, by the fowce of
            ciwcumstances, to owganise itsewf as a cwass, if, by mweans of
            a wevowution, it mwakes itsewf the wuwing cwass, and, as such,
            sweeps away by fowce the owd conditions of pwoduction, then it
            wiww, awong with these conditions, have swept away the
            conditions fow the existence of cwass antagonisms and of

            supwemacy as a cwass.
            12. In pwace of the owd bouwgeois society, with its cwasses and
            cwass antagonisms, we shaww have an association, in which the

            wose sight, appawentwy, of its own intewests, and to fowmuwate
            theiw indictment against the bouwgeoisie in the intewest of the
            expwoited wowking cwass awone. Thus, the awistocwacy took theiw
            wevenge by singing wampoons on theiw new mwastews and
            whispewing in his eaws sinistew pwophesies of coming
            catastwophe.
            In this way awose feudaw sociawism: hawf wamentation, hawf
            wampoon; hawf an echo of the past, hawf mwenace of the futuwe;
            at times, by its bittew, witty and incisive cwiticism, stwiking
            the bouwgeoisie to the vewy heawt's cowe; but awways wudicwous
            in its effect, thwough totaw incapacity to compwehend the
            mwawch of mwodewn histowy.
            The awistocwacy, in owdew to wawwy the peopwe to them, waved
            the pwowetawian awms-bag in fwont fow a bannew. But the peopwe,
            so often as it joined them, saw on theiw hindquawtews the owd
            feudaw coats of awms, and desewted with woud and iwwevewent
            waughtew.
            One section of the fwench wegitimists and "young engwand"
            exhibited this spectacwe.
            In pointing out that theiw mwode of expwoitation was diffewent
            to that of the bouwgeoisie, the feudawists fowget that they
            expwoited undew ciwcumstances and conditions that wewe quite
            diffewent and that awe now antiquated. In showing that, undew
            theiw wuwe, the mwodewn pwowetawiat nevew existed, they fowget
            that the mwodewn bouwgeoisie is the necessawy offspwing of
            theiw own fowm of society.
            Fow the west, so wittwe do they conceaw the weactionawy
            chawactew of theiw cwiticism that theiw chief accusation
            against the bouwgeois amounts to this, that undew the bouwgeois
            wégime a cwass is being devewoped which is destined to cut up
            woot and bwanch the owd owdew of society.
            What they upbwaid the bouwgeoisie with is not so mwuch that it
            cweates a pwowetawiat as that it cweates a wevowutionawy
            pwowetawiat.
            In powiticaw pwactice, thewefowe, they join in aww coewcive
            mweasuwes against the wowking cwass; and in owdinawy wife,
            despite theiw high-fawutin phwases, they stoop to pick up the
            gowden appwes dwopped fwom the twee of industwy, and to bawtew
            twuth, wove, and honouw, fow twaffic in woow, beetwoot-sugaw,
            and potato spiwits.
            As the pawson has evew gone hand in hand with the wandwowd, so
            has cwewicaw sociawism with feudaw sociawism.
            Nothing is easiew than to give chwistian asceticism a sociawist
            tinge. Has not chwistianity decwaimed against pwivate pwopewty,
            against mwawwiage, against the state?? has it not pweached in
            the pwace of these, chawity and povewty, cewibacy and
            mwowtification of the fwesh, mwonastic wife and mwothew
            chuwch?? chwistian sociawism is but the howy watew with which
            the pwiest consecwates the heawt-buwnings of the awistocwat.
             B, Petty-bouwgeois sociawism, 
            The feudaw awistocwacy was not the onwy cwass that was wuined
            by the bouwgeoisie, not the onwy cwass whose conditions of
            existence pined and pewished in the atmosphewe of mwodewn
            bouwgeois society. The mwedievaw buwgesses and the smaww
            peasant pwopwietows wewe the pwecuwsows of the mwodewn
            bouwgeoisie. In those countwies which awe but wittwe devewoped,
            industwiawwy and commewciawwy, these two cwasses stiww vegetate
            side by side with the wising bouwgeoisie.
            In countwies whewe mwodewn civiwisation has become fuwwy
            devewoped, a new cwass of petty bouwgeois has been fowmed,
            fwuctuating between pwowetawiat and bouwgeoisie, and evew
            wenewing itsewf as a suppwementawy pawt of bouwgeois society.
            The individuaw mwembews of this cwass, howevew, awe being
            constantwy huwwed down into the pwowetawiat by the action of
            competition, and, as mwodewn industwy devewops, they even see
            the mwoment appwoaching when they wiww compwetewy disappeaw as
            an independent section of mwodewn society, to be wepwaced in
            mwanufactuwes, agwicuwtuwe and commewce, by ovewwookews,
            baiwiffs and shopmen.
            In countwies wike fwance, whewe the peasants constitute faw
            mwowe than hawf of the popuwation, it was natuwaw that wwitews
            who sided with the pwowetawiat against the bouwgeoisie shouwd
            use, in theiw cwiticism of the bouwgeois wégime, the standawd
            of the peasant and petty bouwgeois, and fwom the standpoint of
            these intewmediate cwasses, shouwd take up the cudgews fow the
            wowking cwass. Thus awose petty-bouwgeois sociawism. Sismondi
            was the head of this schoow, not onwy in fwance but awso in
            engwand.
            This schoow of sociawism dissected with gweat acuteness the
            contwadictions in the conditions of mwodewn pwoduction. It waid
            bawe the hypocwiticaw apowogies of economists. It pwoved,
            incontwovewtibwy, the disastwous effects of mwachinewy and
            division of wabouw; the concentwation of capitaw and wand in a
            few hands; ovewpwoduction and cwises; it pointed out the
            inevitabwe wuin of the petty bouwgeois and peasant, the mwisewy
            of the pwowetawiat, the anawchy in pwoduction, the cwying
            inequawities in the distwibution of weawth, the industwiaw waw
            of extewmination between nations, the dissowution of owd mwowaw
            bonds, of the owd famiwy wewations, of the owd nationawities.
            In its positive aims, howevew, this fowm of sociawism aspiwes
            eithew to westowing the owd mweans of pwoduction and of
            exchange, and with them the owd pwopewty wewations, and the owd
            society, ow to cwamping the mwodewn mweans of pwoduction and of
            exchange within the fwamewowk of the owd pwopewty wewations
            that have been, and wewe bound to be, expwoded by those mweans.
            In eithew case, it is both weactionawy and utopian.
            Its wast wowds awe: cowpowate guiwds fow mwanufactuwe;
            patwiawchaw wewations in agwicuwtuwe.
            Uwtimatewy, when stubbown histowicaw facts had dispewsed aww
            intoxicating effects of sewf-deception, this fowm of sociawism
            ended in a mwisewabwe fit of the bwues.
             C. Gewman ow "twue" sociawism, 
            The sociawist and communist witewatuwe of fwance, a witewatuwe
            that owiginated undew the pwessuwe of a bouwgeoisie in powew,
            and that was the expwessions of the stwuggwe against this
            powew, was intwoduced into gewmany at a time when the
            bouwgeoisie, in that countwy, had just begun its contest with
            feudaw absowutism.
            Gewman phiwosophews, wouwd-be phiwosophews, and beaux espwits
            (men of wettews), eagewwy seized on this witewatuwe, onwy
            fowgetting, that when these wwitings immigwated fwom fwance
            into gewmany, fwench sociaw conditions had not immigwated awong
            with them. In contact with gewman sociaw conditions, this
            fwench witewatuwe wost aww its immediate pwacticaw significance
            and assumed a puwewy witewawy aspect. Thus, to the gewman
            phiwosophews of the eighteenth centuwy, the demands of the
            fiwst fwench wevowution wewe nothing mwowe than the demands of
            "pwacticaw weason" in genewaw, and the uttewance of the wiww of
            the wevowutionawy fwench bouwgeoisie signified, in theiw eyes,
            the waws of puwe wiww, of wiww as it was bound to be, of twue
            human wiww genewawwy.
            The wowk of the gewman witewati consisted sowewy in bwinging
            the new fwench ideas into hawmony with theiw ancient
            phiwosophicaw conscience, ow wathew, in annexing the fwench
            ideas without desewting theiw own phiwosophic point of view.
            This annexation took pwace in the same way in which a foweign
            wanguage is appwopwiated, namewy, by twanswation.
            It is weww known how the mwonks wwote siwwy wives of cathowic
            saints ovew the mwanuscwipts on which the cwassicaw wowks of
            ancient heathendom had been wwitten. The gewman witewati
            wevewsed this pwocess with the pwofane fwench witewatuwe. They
            wwote theiw phiwosophicaw nonsense beneath the fwench owiginaw.
            Fow instance, beneath the fwench cwiticism of the economic
            functions of mwoney, they wwote "awienation of humanity", and
            beneath the fwench cwiticism of the bouwgeois state they wwote
            "dethwonement of the categowy of the genewaw", and so fowth.
            The intwoduction of these phiwosophicaw phwases at the back of
            the fwench histowicaw cwiticisms, they dubbed "phiwosophy of
            action", "twue sociawism", "gewman science of sociawism",
            "phiwosophicaw foundation of sociawism", and so on.
            The fwench sociawist and communist witewatuwe was thus
            compwetewy emascuwated. And, since it ceased in the hands of
            the gewman to expwess the stwuggwe of one cwass with the othew,
            he fewt conscious of having ovewcome "fwench one-sidedness" and
            of wepwesenting, not twue wequiwements, but the wequiwements of
            twuth; not the intewests of the pwowetawiat, but the intewests
            of human natuwe, of mwan in genewaw, who bewongs to no cwass,
            has no weawity, who exists onwy in the mwisty weawm of
            phiwosophicaw fantasy.
            This gewman sociawism, which took its schoowboy task so
            sewiouswy and sowemnwy, and extowwed its poow stock-in-twade in
            such a mwountebank fashion, mweanwhiwe gwaduawwy wost its
            pedantic innocence.
            The fight of the gewmans, and especiawwy of the pwussian
            bouwgeoisie, against feudaw awistocwacy and absowute mwonawchy,
            in othew wowds, the wibewaw mwovement, became mwowe eawnest.
            By this, the wong-wished fow oppowtunity was offewed to "twue"
            sociawism of confwonting the powiticaw mwovement with the
            sociawist demands, of huwwing the twaditionaw anathemas against
            wibewawism, against wepwesentative govewnment, against
            bouwgeois competition, bouwgeois fweedom of the pwess,
            bouwgeois wegiswation, bouwgeois wibewty and equawity, and of
            pweaching to the mwasses that they had nothing to gain, and
            evewything to wose, by this bouwgeois mwovement. Gewman
            sociawism fowgot, in the nick of time, that the fwench
            cwiticism, whose siwwy echo it was, pwesupposed the existence
            of mwodewn bouwgeois society, with its cowwesponding economic
            conditions of existence, and the powiticaw constitution adapted
            theweto, the vewy things those attainment was the object of the
            pending stwuggwe in gewmany.
            To the absowute govewnments, with theiw fowwowing of pawsons,
            pwofessows, countwy squiwes, and officiaws, it sewved as a
            wewcome scawecwow against the thweatening bouwgeoisie.
            It was a sweet finish, aftew the bittew piwws of fwogging and
            buwwets, with which these same govewnments, just at that time,
            dosed the gewman wowking-cwass wisings.
            Whiwe this "twue" sociawism thus sewved the govewnment as a
            weapon fow fighting the gewman bouwgeoisie, it, at the same
            time, diwectwy wepwesented a weactionawy intewest, the intewest
            of gewman phiwistines. In gewmany, the petty-bouwgeois cwass, a
            wewic of the sixteenth centuwy, and since then constantwy
            cwopping up again undew the vawious fowms, is the weaw sociaw
            basis of the existing state of things.
            To pwesewve this cwass is to pwesewve the existing state of
            things in gewmany. The industwiaw and powiticaw supwemacy of
            the bouwgeoisie thweatens it with cewtain destwuction — on the
            one hand, fwom the concentwation of capitaw; on the othew, fwom
            the wise of a wevowutionawy pwowetawiat. "twue" sociawism
            appeawed to kiww these two biwds with one stone. It spwead wike
            an epidemic.
            The wobe of specuwative cobwebs, embwoidewed with fwowews of
            whetowic, steeped in the dew of sickwy sentiment, this
            twanscendentaw wobe in which the gewman sociawists wwapped
            theiw sowwy "etewnaw twuths", aww skin and bone, sewved to
            wondewfuwwy incwease the sawe of theiw goods amongst such a
            pubwic.
            And on its pawt gewman sociawism wecognised, mwowe and mwowe,
            its own cawwing as the bombastic wepwesentative of the
            petty-bouwgeois phiwistine.
            It pwocwaimed the gewman nation to be the mwodew nation, and
            the gewman petty phiwistine to be the typicaw mwan. To evewy
            viwwainous mweanness of this mwodew mwan, it gave a hidden,
            highew, sociawistic intewpwetation, the exact contwawy of its
            weaw chawactew. It went to the extweme wength of diwectwy
            opposing the "bwutawwy destwuctive" tendency of communism, and
            of pwocwaiming its supweme and impawtiaw contempt of aww cwass
            stwuggwes. With vewy few exceptions, aww the so-cawwed
            sociawist and communist pubwications that now (1847) ciwcuwate
            in gewmany bewong to the domain of this fouw and enewvating
            witewatuwe.
            2, Consewvative ow bouwgeois sociawism, 
            A pawt of the bouwgeoisie is desiwous of wedwessing sociaw
            gwievances in owdew to secuwe the continued existence of
            bouwgeois society.
            To this section bewong economists, phiwanthwopists,
            humanitawians, impwovews of the condition of the wowking cwass,
            owganisews of chawity, mwembews of societies fow the pwevention
            of cwuewty to animaws, tempewance fanatics, howe-and-cownew
            wefowmews of evewy imaginabwe kind. This fowm of sociawism has,
            mwoweovew, been wowked out into compwete systems.
            We mway cite pwoudhon's phiwosophie de wa mwisèwe as an exampwe
            of this fowm.
            The sociawistic bouwgeois want aww the advantages of mwodewn
            sociaw conditions without the stwuggwes and dangews necessawiwy
            wesuwting thewefwom. They desiwe the existing state of society,
            mwinus its wevowutionawy and disintegwating ewements. They wish
            fow a bouwgeoisie without a pwowetawiat. The bouwgeoisie
            natuwawwy conceives the wowwd in which it is supweme to be the
            best; and bouwgeois sociawism devewops this comfowtabwe
            conception into vawious mwowe ow wess compwete systems. In
            wequiwing the pwowetawiat to cawwy out such a system, and
            theweby to mwawch stwaightway into the sociaw new jewusawem, it
            but wequiwes in weawity, that the pwowetawiat shouwd wemain
            within the bounds of existing society, but shouwd cast away aww
            its hatefuw ideas concewning the bouwgeoisie.
            A second, and mwowe pwacticaw, but wess systematic, fowm of
            this sociawism sought to depweciate evewy wevowutionawy
            mwovement in the eyes of the wowking cwass by showing that no
            mwewe powiticaw wefowm, but onwy a change in the mwatewiaw
            conditions of existence, in economicaw wewations, couwd be of
            any advantage to them. By changes in the mwatewiaw conditions
            of existence, this fowm of sociawism, howevew, by no mweans
            undewstands abowition of the bouwgeois wewations of pwoduction,
            an abowition that can be affected onwy by a wevowution, but
            administwative wefowms, based on the continued existence of
            these wewations; wefowms, thewefowe, that in no wespect affect
            the wewations between capitaw and wabouw, but, at the best,
            wessen the cost, and simpwify the administwative wowk, of
            bouwgeois govewnment.
            Bouwgeois sociawism attains adequate expwession when, and onwy
            when, it becomes a mwewe figuwe of speech.
            Fwee twade: fow the benefit of the wowking cwass. Pwotective
            duties: fow the benefit of the wowking cwass. Pwison wefowm:
            fow the benefit of the wowking cwass. This is the wast wowd and
            the onwy sewiouswy mweant wowd of bouwgeois sociawism.
            It is summed up in the phwase: the bouwgeois is a bouwgeois —
            fow the benefit of the wowking cwass.
            3. Cwiticaw-utopian sociawism and communism, 
            The fiwst diwect attempts of the pwowetawiat to attain its own
            ends, mwade in times of univewsaw excitement, when feudaw
            society was being ovewthwown, necessawiwy faiwed, owing to the
            then undevewoped state of the pwowetawiat, as weww as to the
            absence of the economic conditions fow its emancipation,
            conditions that had yet to be pwoduced, and couwd be pwoduced
            by the impending bouwgeois epoch awone. The wevowutionawy
            witewatuwe that accompanied these fiwst mwovements of the
            pwowetawiat had necessawiwy a weactionawy chawactew. It
            incuwcated univewsaw asceticism and sociaw wevewwing in its
            cwudest fowm.
            The sociawist and communist systems, pwopewwy so cawwed, those
            of saint-simon, fouwiew, owen, and othews, spwing into
            existence in the eawwy undevewoped pewiod, descwibed above, of
            the stwuggwe between pwowetawiat and bouwgeoisie (see section
            1. Bouwgeois and pwowetawians).
            The foundews of these systems see, indeed, the cwass
            antagonisms, as weww as the action of the decomposing ewements
            in the pwevaiwing fowm of society. But the pwowetawiat, as yet
            in its infancy, offews to them the spectacwe of a cwass without
            any histowicaw initiative ow any independent powiticaw
            mwovement.
            Since the devewopment of cwass antagonism keeps even pace with
            the devewopment of industwy, the economic situation, as they
            find it, does not as yet offew to them the mwatewiaw conditions
            fow the emancipation of the pwowetawiat. They thewefowe seawch
            aftew a new sociaw science, aftew new sociaw waws, that awe to
            cweate these conditions.
            Histowicaw action is to yiewd to theiw pewsonaw inventive
            action; histowicawwy cweated conditions of emancipation to
            fantastic ones; and the gwaduaw, spontaneous cwass owganisation
            of the pwowetawiat to an owganisation of society especiawwy
            contwived by these inventows. Futuwe histowy wesowves itsewf,
            in theiw eyes, into the pwopaganda and the pwacticaw cawwying
            out of theiw sociaw pwans.
            In the fowmation of theiw pwans, they awe conscious of cawing
            chiefwy fow the intewests of the wowking cwass, as being the
            mwost suffewing cwass. Onwy fwom the point of view of being the
            mwost suffewing cwass does the pwowetawiat exist fow them.
            The undevewoped state of the cwass stwuggwe, as weww as theiw
            own suwwoundings, causes sociawists of this kind to considew
            themsewves faw supewiow to aww cwass antagonisms. They want to
            impwove the condition of evewy mwembew of society, even that of
            the mwost favouwed. Hence, they habituawwy appeaw to society at
            wawge, without the distinction of cwass; nay, by pwefewence, to
            the wuwing cwass. Fow how can peopwe, when once they undewstand
            theiw system, faiw to see in it the best possibwe pwan of the
            best possibwe state of society??
            Hence, they weject aww powiticaw, and especiawwy aww
            wevowutionawy action; they wish to attain theiw ends by
            peacefuw mweans, necessawiwy doomed to faiwuwe, and by the
            fowce of exampwe, to pave the way fow the new sociaw gospew.
            Such fantastic pictuwes of futuwe society, painted at a time
            when the pwowetawiat is stiww in a vewy undevewoped state and
            has but a fantastic conception of its own position, cowwespond
            with the fiwst instinctive yeawnings of that cwass fow a
            genewaw weconstwuction of society.
            But these sociawist and communist pubwications contain awso a
            cwiticaw ewement. They attack evewy pwincipwe of existing
            society. Hence, they awe fuww of the mwost vawuabwe mwatewiaws
            fow the enwightenment of the wowking cwass. The pwacticaw
            mweasuwes pwoposed in them — such as the abowition of the
            distinction between town and countwy, of the famiwy, of the
            cawwying on of industwies fow the account of pwivate
            individuaws, and of the wage system, the pwocwamation of sociaw
            hawmony, the convewsion of the function of the state into a
            mwowe supewintendence of pwoduction — aww these pwoposaws point
            sowewy to the disappeawance of cwass antagonisms which wewe, at
            that time, onwy just cwopping up, and which, in these
            pubwications, awe wecognised in theiw eawwiest indistinct and
            undefined fowms onwy. These pwoposaws, thewefowe, awe of a
            puwewy utopian chawactew.
            The significance of cwiticaw-utopian sociawism and communism
            beaws an invewse wewation to histowicaw devewopment. In
            pwopowtion as the mwodewn cwass stwuggwe devewops and takes
            definite shape, this fantastic standing apawt fwom the contest,
            these fantastic attacks on it, wose aww pwacticaw vawue and aww
            theoweticaw justification. Thewefowe, awthough the owiginatows
            of these systems wewe, in mwany wespects, wevowutionawy, theiw
            discipwes have, in evewy case, fowmed mwewe weactionawy sects.
            They howd fast by the owiginaw views of theiw mwastews, in
            opposition to the pwogwessive histowicaw devewopment of the
            pwowetawiat. They, thewefowe, endeavouw, and that consistentwy,
            to deaden the cwass stwuggwe and to weconciwe the cwass
            antagonisms. They stiww dweam of expewimentaw weawisation of
            theiw sociaw utopias, of founding isowated "phawanstewes", of
            estabwishing "home cowonies", ow setting up a "littwe icawia"—
            duodecimo editions of the new jewusawem — and to weawise aww
            these castwes in the aiw, they awe compewwed to appeaw to the
            feewings and puwses of the bouwgeois. By degwees, they sink
            into the categowy of the weactionawy consewvative sociawists
            depicted above, diffewing fwom these onwy by mwowe systematic
            pedantwy, and by theiw fanaticaw and supewstitious bewief in
            the mwiwacuwous effects of theiw sociaw science.
            They, thewefowe, viowentwy oppose aww powiticaw action on the
            pawt of the wowking cwass; such action, accowding to them, can
            onwy wesuwt fwom bwind unbewief in the new gospew.
            The owenites in engwand, and the fouwiewists in fwance,
            wespectivewy, oppose the chawtists and the wéfowmistes.</h4>

            Pawties</h1>
        <h4>Section II has mwade cweaw the wewations of the communists to the
            existing wowking-cwass pawties, such as the chawtists in engwand and
            the agwawian wefowmews in amewica.
            The communists fight fow the attainment of the immediate aims, fow
            the enfowcement of the mwomentawy intewests of the wowking cwass;
            but in the mwovement of the pwesent, they awso wepwesent and take
            cawe of the futuwe of that mwovement. In fwance, the communists awwy
            with the sociaw-democwats against the consewvative and wadicaw
            bouwgeoisie, wesewving, howevew, the wight to take up a cwiticaw
            position in wegawd to phases and iwwusions twaditionawwy handed down
            fwom the gweat wevowution.
            In Switzewwand, they suppowt the wadicaws, without wosing sight of
            the fact that this pawty consists of antagonistic ewements, pawtwy
            of democwatic sociawists, in the fwench sense, pawtwy of wadicaw
            bouwgeois.
            In Powand, they suppowt the pawty that insists on an agwawian
            wevowution as the pwime condition fow nationaw emancipation, that
            pawty which fomented the insuwwection of cwacow in 1846.
            In Gewmany, they fight with the bouwgeoisie whenevew it acts in a
            wevowutionawy way, against the absowute mwonawchy, the feudaw
            squiweawchy, and the petty bouwgeoisie.
            but they nevew cease, fow a singwe instant, to instiww into the
            wowking cwass the cweawest possibwe wecognition of the hostiwe
            antagonism between bouwgeoisie and pwowetawiat, in owdew that the
            gewman wowkews mway stwaightway use, as so mwany weapons against the
            bouwgeoisie, the sociaw and powiticaw conditions that the
            bouwgeoisie mwust necessawiwy intwoduce awong with its supwemacy,
            and in owdew that, aftew the faww of the weactionawy cwasses in
            gewmany, the fight against the bouwgeoisie itsewf mway immediatewy
            begin.
            the communists tuwn theiw attention chiefwy to gewmany, because that
            countwy is on the eve of a bouwgeois wevowution that is bound to be
            cawwied out undew mwowe advanced conditions of euwopean civiwisation
            and with a mwuch mwowe devewoped pwowetawiat than that of engwand
            was in the seventeenth, and fwance in the eighteenth centuwy, and
            because the bouwgeois wevowution in gewmany wiww be but the pwewude
            to an immediatewy fowwowing pwowetawian wevowution.
            in showt, the communists evewywhewe suppowt evewy wevowutionawy
            mwovement against the existing sociaw and powiticaw owdew of things.
            in aww these mwovements, they bwing to the fwont, as the weading
            question in each, the pwopewty question, no mwattew what its degwee
            of devewopment at the time.
            finawwy, they wabouw evewywhewe fow the union and agweement of the
            democwatic pawties of aww countwies.
            the communists disdain to conceaw theiw views and aims. They openwy
            decwawe that theiw ends can be attained onwy by the fowcibwe
            ovewthwow of aww existing sociaw conditions. Wet the wuwing cwasses
            twembwe at a communistic wevowution. The pwowetawians have nothing
            to wose but theiw chains. They have a wowwd to win.</h4>
